    "Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game played with two players. Based on an older game called Bulls and Cows, Mastermind puts an emphasis on strategy and logical thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Mastermind is a simplified variation of the highly complex game where the code is made using colors and numbers. In this version, a code will be randomly generated with a length that varies from 1 to 10 digits long with he colors being replaced with 0-9 non-repeating numbers. After each guess made, the correct number of guesses in the correct position will be revealed. Hints are available if requested, where the generated digit is disclosed according to the desired location.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the player wishes for a 4- digit code to be generated, the computer could spit out the number 6790. the player then has to guess the correct numbers and their correct positions to the best of their abilities. If a hint is requested then the player must input the numerical value of the placement of the digit they want revealed. Asking for the first position of the secret code would need an input of the value one (1) where then the computer will return the value six (6). There are an infinite amount of tries and hints made available to the player.\n",
